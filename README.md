# Java Learning Journey: From Backend Development to Cybersecurity

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to my repository! This is a documentation of my learning journey through the **Java programming language**, where I explore its power in backend development and its critical application in **cybersecurity**. My ultimate goal is to master building **safe, secure, and efficient APIs** using **Spring Framework** and related tools.

## üß© What You'll Find Here

This repository is a curated collection of:
- **Code Examples**: Illustrating core Java concepts and advanced techniques.
- **Backend Development Projects**: Showcasing the use of Java in server-side development.
- **Cybersecurity Applications**: Applying Java to secure APIs against vulnerabilities like SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, and more.
- **Spring Framework Demos**: Highlighting key features like dependency injection, RESTful services, authentication, and authorization.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

- **`basics/`**: Java fundamentals like data types, control structures, OOP principles, and exception handling.
- **`advanced/`**: Topics including multithreading, collections, and Java Streams.
- **`backend/`**: Backend-focused code, such as database integration (JDBC, JPA), RESTful services, and API design.
- **`security/`**: Implementations of secure coding practices, encryption, and authentication mechanisms in Spring.
- **`projects/`**: Mini-projects to demonstrate practical use cases combining backend development and security.

## üåü Goals of This Journey

1. Build a solid foundation in **Java programming**.
2. Learn backend technologies and frameworks like **Spring**.
3. Apply **secure coding principles** to create robust APIs.
4. Explore **cybersecurity practices** for backend systems.
5. Share insights and progress to help others on similar paths.

## üîê Cybersecurity in Focus

In today's world, ensuring the safety of APIs is non-negotiable. Throughout this repository, you'll find:
- How to configure **Spring Security** for role-based access control.
- Techniques for **securing sensitive data** with encryption and hashing.
- Strategies for mitigating common vulnerabilities in web APIs.

## üìö References and Resources

I‚Äôm leveraging a variety of resources to deepen my knowledge, including:
- [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Spring Framework Documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
- Cybersecurity references like OWASP guidelines.
